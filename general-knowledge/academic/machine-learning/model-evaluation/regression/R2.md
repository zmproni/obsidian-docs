# $R^2$
Known as the coefficient of determination. It measures the goodness of fit on a regression task model. [Source](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/webtemplate/ask-assets/external/maths-resources/statistics/regression-and-correlation/coefficient-of-determination-r-squared.html).

$$R^2=1-{\text{sum squared regression (SSR)} \over \text{total sum of squares (SST)}}$$
or:
$$R^2=1-{\sum(y_i - \hat y_i)^2 \over \sum (y_i - \bar y)^2}$$
Where: 
$y_i$ -> actual value
$\hat y_i$ -> estimated value
$\bar y$ -> population mean 

## Interpretation
$R^2 = 1$ -> All variation in $y$ values is accounted for by the $x$ values 
$R^2 = 0.83$ -> 83% variation in $y$ values is accounted for by the $x$ values 
$R^2 = 0$ -> No variation in $y$ values is accounted for by the $x$ values 

## Calculate
|$x$|$y$||||||
