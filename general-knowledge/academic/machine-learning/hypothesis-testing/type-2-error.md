# Type 2 Errors
Is the statistical name given to false negatives. Occurs when a test incorrectly fails to reject a false null hypothesis. In other words, it's when a test declares that an effect does not exist when in fact it does. The probability of making a Type 2 error is represented by the probability of beta (Î²), which is related to the power of the test.
