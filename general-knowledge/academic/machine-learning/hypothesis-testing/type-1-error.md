# Type 1 Error 
Refers to the statistical name given to **False Positives**. Occurs when a test incorrectly rejects a true null hypothesis. In other words, it's when a test declares that an effect exists when in fact it does not. The probability of making a Type 1 error is represented by the significance level (Î±), which is usually set at 0.05.
