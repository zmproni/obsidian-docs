# Hypothesis Testing 

## Null Hypothesis 

## p-value 
The p-value is a statistical measure used to asses the evidence against the null hypothesis. Traditionally the significance level of a hypothesis is set at 0.05, if the p-value is greater than the significance level (p > 0.05), then it is not statistically significant to reject the null-hypothesis. If the p-value is smaller than the significance level (p > 0.05), then *the observed difference* is considered statistically significant and the null hypothesis is rejected. 

Therefore:
- p-value > significance level -> not significant -> do not reject $H_0$
- p-value < significance level -> significant -> reject $H_0$
