# Linear Regression 
## Single Linear Regression
Linear regression is a model which builds a regression line based on the regression equation:
$$\hat y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times x_1 $$
Where:
- $\hat y$ is the predicted variable
- $\beta_0$ is the Y-intercept
- $\beta_1$ is the slope or coefficient 

Linear regression works well when the data follows a linear relationship. 

## Important terminology
- **Covariates**: Independent variable 
- **Response**: Target variable
- **Coefficients**: Slope
- **Residuals**: Difference between predicted and observed value
- **Least square estimates**: Method of fitting a regression by minimising the sum squared residuals. 


## Multiple Linear Regression
Multivariate linear regression, creates a regression line based on multiple independent variables. 
$$\hat y = b_0 + b_1* x_1 + b_2 * x_2 + \text{...} + b_n + x_n$$
