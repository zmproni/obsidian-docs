# Memorisation Methods
Memorisation methods refer to machine learning models that use statistical majorities or averages to compute a prediction. 

Topics:
- Single variable models 
- Multivariate models
- Decision tree, kNN, Naive Bayes

## Single Variable Models 
Refers to models trained on 1 dependent and 1 independent variables.

## Multivariate Models 
Refers to models trained on 1 dependent and more than 1 independent variables.

## Models 
- Decision Trees 
- kNN
