# Rules of thumb 
## Considerations 
- When to use 2D vs. 3D
- Eyes vs. Memory
- Immersion or distraction
- Overviews 
- Too long or too short
- Form or function

## Dangers of 3D
### Occlusion
How to resolve?
- Interaction
- Transparency 
- Aggregation
### Perspective Distortion
- size channels become harder to perceive
- text legibility becomes harder 
### Solution
- Consider a different means of communicating 
## When to use 3D
- The data is intrinsically 3D 
- Interaction is useful and important 
### Example: 
- Fluid flow
- Air resistance 
### Notes:
Almost never have 3D bar charts, always better to see in 2D
[Interesting take](https://youtu.be/GTTWM8SzCnw?list=PLT4XLHmqHJBfKoeHlmgQYP9c_KMj_dR1I&t=539). 
  
  
## Eyes beat memory
### External cognition vs internal memory 
Easier to compare moving eyes side to side.  
Harder to see an idiom then change page and compare with another. 

### Implication for animation
Great for storytelling and sequential information presentation 
  
  
## Resolution beats immersion
### Immersion is great for:
- Spacial data 
- 3D Structure 
### When not to:
- Abstract data is hard to encode effectively
- Spreadsheets on Desktop vs. VR 
  
  
## Overview first, zoom and filter, details in demand
- Mantra from Shneiderman
When you can make an overview, make an overview. 
  
  
## Responsiveness is required
Visual feedback categories:
- 0.1s - perceptual processing 
- 1s    - immediate response
- 10s  - brief tasks
Each category need to have different considerations. 
Communicating the progress is important for long computations. 

  
## Function over Form 
You can improve the form of the functional idiom. 
Choosing an idiom by form will limit function. 
### Basic Design Ideas:
- proximity 
- alignment
- repetition 
- contrast
### Best Practices 
- Make visualisations self documenting 
	- labelling
	- titling 
	- legends
