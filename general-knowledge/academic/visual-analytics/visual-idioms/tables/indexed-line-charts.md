## Idiom Analysis 
### Data
- 1 key 
- 1 value 
### Derived data 
New quantitative value 
- Index 
- plot instead of original value
### Task
- Principle: normalised, not absolute
### Scalability 
- Same as line chart 


## Notes 
Indexed line charts are a type of line chart that uses an index to plot the data. Instead of plotting the data points on the y-axis using their actual values, they are plotted using their relative position to other data points. This is useful when the data points have different scales, or when the data is indexed by time, which can make it difficult to compare data points across different time periods.

The indexed line chart is created by normalising the data points by dividing them by a selected base value and then plotting the resulting percentage value. This creates a chart where all lines start at the same point (0%), making it easy to compare their relative movements. This type of chart is useful for showing trends over time, when the data set has multiple variables and the chart need to show the relative changes over time rather than the absolute values.

### Key value explanation
An example key value for an indexed line chart would be the base value that is used to normalize the data points. This value is selected by the user and can be any value within the range of the data. For example, if a dataset contains stock prices for a specific company, the user can select the stock price at the beginning of the period as the base value. With this base value, the chart will show how the stock prices have changed relative to the initial value.

For example if stock prices over time is the data and the user selects the first day of the period as the base value, the chart will show the percentage change in stock prices relative to the first day's prices over time. This allows the user to compare the relative changes in stock prices over time, rather than the absolute values.
