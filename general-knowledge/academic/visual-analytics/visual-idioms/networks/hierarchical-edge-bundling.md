# Hierarchical 

Conjoining links that exit from neighbouring nodes and splitting when the link diverges into a distant node. It is another technique to reduce clutter when the data points contain numerous distant links and fuzzy-cluster relationships. Fuzzy clusters are clusters that allow data points to exist in more than one cluster.
