# Circular Layouts | Arc Diagrams

The idea behind circular layouts is to reduce clutter, through node ordering the position of nodes can visually encode the clusters and dense relationships among neighbour nodes.

Image below shows a [node link tree](obsidian://open?vault=general-knowledge&file=academic%2Fvisual-analytics%2Fvisual-idioms%2Fnetworks%2Fnode-link-tree) in the a circular layout. Not to be confused with arc diagrams as the image above displays.

## Considerations  
### Node ordering (global computation)
Refers to the ordering of nodes such that the adjacent nodes have the most connection with each other to minimise cross-over.
