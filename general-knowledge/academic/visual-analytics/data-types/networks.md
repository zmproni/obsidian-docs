# Network Data 
## Objectives 
- What are networks 
- What comprises networks 
- What are visual idioms that represent networks

## Definitions
### Networks
Networks are one of the three [dataset types](dataset-types.md). Networks are a collection of nodes and links. Can show hierarchical data with trees as well as graphs and node-link graphs. 
### Nodes
### Links

## Tasks 
### Topology based tasks 
- Find paths 
Can you get from one node to another node? 
**Example**: How does closing down a street affect the road the drivers have to take to go from point A to point B 
- Find neighbours 
- Compare centrality/importance measures 
- Identify clusters / communities 
- Find paths
> Network diagrams

### Attribute based tasks
Examine the data points (individual and group) based on their attributes such as: colour, size, length, preferences. 
- find distributions
- show decision process
> How can we do this with networks? 

 Trees can model hierarchy but they can also separate data based on attributes. [Decision trees](academic/machine-learning/decision-tree/decision-tree) in machine learning 

### Combination tasks 
- Neighbours and preferences 
This can be a network of friends and each friend has a set of attributes.
