## Creating a struct
```rust 
struct User {
	name: String,
	email: String,
	sign_in_count: u64,
	active: bool,
}

```

##
```rust

fn main() {
	let user = User {
		email: String::from("user@email.com"),
		username: String::from("user name"),
		active: true,
		sign_in_count: 1
	}	
	let name = user.username;
	user.username = String::from("new username")
}

fn build_user(email:String, username:String) -> User {
	User {
		email,
		username,
		active: true,
		sign_in_count: 1,
	}
}
```
