## Borrowing & References 
### Ownership
Rust uses the concept of ownership for memory management.  

Whoever has ownership of a variable, is in charge of cleaning it up when the owner goes out of scope. 
```rust 
#[derive(Debug)]
struct SomeStruct {
	num: i32,
}
```
Note: The derive macro generates an implementation of the trait is passed in. 

```rust
fn print_some_struct(the_struct: SomeStruct) {
	println!("{:?}", the_struct);
}
```

By default in Rust when a variable is passed to a function, the function takes ownership of the variable. 

This means that in the code below, the variable `some_struct` is passed out of the `main()` scope and into the first `print_some_struct` scope. Once the function runs, the `some_struct` variable is de-allocated from memory. 
```rust 
fn main() {
	let some_struct = SomeStruct { num: 3 };
	print_some_struct(some_struct); // Ok 
	print_some_struct(some_struct); // Error
}
```

## Create a deep copy of the object
### Clone 
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct SomeStruct {
	num: i32,
}
...

fn main() {
	...
	print_some_struct(some_struct.clone()); // Ok 
	print_some_struct(some_struct.clone()); // Ok
}

```

### Copy 
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
struct SomeStruct {
	num: i32,
}
...
fn main() {
	...
	print_some_struct(some_struct); // Ok
// Clones without calling the .clone() function
	print_some_struct(some_struct); // Ok
}

```

## Borrowing and Lending
### Read only reference
```rust 
...
print_some_struct(&some_struct); 
print_some_struct(&some_struct); 
```
Can create and pass as many read only references as you want. 

### Mutable references 
Can only create one mutable reference
```rust
...

fn mutate_struct(&mut struc) { ... }

fn main() {
	let mut some_struct = SomeStruct { num: 3 }
	mutate_struct(&mut some_struct) 
	// Only one at a time
}
```

## Lifetimes 
```rust
fn biggest<'l>(a &'l SomeStruct, b &'l SomeStruct) -> &'l SomeStruct {
	if a.num > b.num { return a }
	return b
}

fn main( ){
	let mut some_struct = SomeStruct { num: 3 };
	let bigger: SomeStruct;
	
	let other_struct = SomeStruct { num: 5 };
	bigger = biggest(a, b); 
}
```
- Only relevant for references
- Dont change the lifetimes of the parameters 
- They can be inferred
- Prevents dangling references

## Struct Lifetimes
```rust
struct SomeStruct<'a> {
	num: &'a i32,
}
```
