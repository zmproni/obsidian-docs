## The Game
"We’ll implement a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game. Here’s how it works: the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit."

## Cargo
```bash
cargo add <package>
cargo update 
```

## Rust 

```rust 
let mut input = String::new();
io::stdin()
	.read_line(&mut input)
	.expect("Failed to read line");
```

```rust 
let guess_number: i8 = match input.trim().parse() {
	Ok(num) => num,
	Err(_) => continue
};
```

```rust
match value.cmp(&guess_number) {
	Ordering::Less => println!("Guess lower"),
	Ordering::Greater => println!("Guess higher"),
	Ordering::Equal => {
		println!("Correct!");
		break;
	}
}
```
