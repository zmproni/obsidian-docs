Rust is a low-level language with an expressive and ergonomic syntaxt that allow the user to write anything from "system-level" code, cli applications, web servers and more. 

Traditional low-level coding for "system-level" devices come with the risk of dangerous pitfalls and security vulnerabilities. Rust aims to address those concerns by changing the way code memory is written and managed, as well as introducing a compiler that can detect run time errors at compile time.

Ultimately, the Rust programming language has become a way to empower coders by freeing them of limiting worries and letting them write memory safe code without the years of experience needed to understand how to write the same programs safely in other languages.
