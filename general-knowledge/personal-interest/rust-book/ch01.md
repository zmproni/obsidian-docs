# Chapter 1
## Installation 
### Local Rust Documentation
```bash
rustup docs
```
Running the above code opens up a local version of the rust documentation in your default browser. 

### Manually update path 
Make sure path points to the `.../.cargo/bin` folder. Not doing so will create errors with Visual Studio Code. 

## Hello World 
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
This code prints the message "Hello, world!" to the console. The program needs to be compiled using the rustc command. 
```bash
# rustc <file-name>
rustc main.rs
```
This creates a compiled executable. On linux, you can run the file like this:
```bash
# ./<file-name-no-extention>
./main
```
### Macros 
```rust
println!()
```
Is a macro. A macro defines lines of code that will replace the macro call during compile time. 

## Cargo
```bash
cargo --version #-v 
```
Checks cargo's version, good to check if cargo has been installed. 

To create a new project:
```bash
cargo new project
cd project
```
When creating a project with cargo, git version control is automatically added to the project.

Cargo build compiles your cargo project and creates an executable file in the project's target folder. 
```bash
cargo build
cargo run
```
You don't have to run the 'build' command before runnung the 'run' command. The 'run' command compiles the code, creates and executable and executes it. 

If you want to compile the code without creating an executable (faster), then you can run:
```bash
cargo check
```
