# A repository for personal Obsidian notes 
This is born out of a need for a free and convinient solution for note syncing for 
Obsidian across various devices and operating systems. I'd like to mention not 
everything written in these notes is correct as they are usually taken in for personal 
refrence and are not throughly fact checked.
